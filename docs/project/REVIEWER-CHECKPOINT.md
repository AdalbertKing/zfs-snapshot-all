# REVIEWER CHECKPOINT

Purpose: compact bootstrap for ChatGPT reviewer. This file is a convenience index, **not** the canonical source of volatile review state. If anything here disagrees with `main`, `docs/project/OPEN-THREADS.md`, `docs/internal/reviews/REVIEW_LEDGER.md`, exact review/response/closure artifacts, or `docs/project/ACTIVE-WORK-PLAN.md`, the fresher canonical artifact wins.

## Mandatory start of every Check / reviewer write

1. fresh READ of `main`;
2. move `reviewer-write-probe` to that exact SHA;
3. read the probe back and verify exact SHA;
4. only then review or write;
5. never probe writes on production code/main itself.

Roles: Claude = implementer, ChatGPT = independent reviewer/architect, Owner = user. GitHub is the protocol between Claude and reviewer. Never accept implementer claims without exact diff/artifact/evidence inspection.

Review protocol:
- reviewer: `docs/internal/reviews/REV-YYYYMMDD-NNN.md`
- implementer response: `docs/internal/reviews/responses/REV-YYYYMMDD-NNN.md`
- closure: `docs/internal/reviews/closures/REV-YYYYMMDD-NNN.md`
- generated routing: `docs/internal/reviews/REVIEW_LEDGER.md`, `docs/project/OPEN-THREADS.md`
- gate: `./test/impact.sh --verify`

State model: `OPEN -> IMPLEMENTED -> APPROVED -> CLOSED`; same acceptance property stays the same REV, independent defect gets a new REV.

## Durable owner contracts

**Reduction, not complication.** Prefer the smallest safe rule, refusal on ambiguity, and native CONFIG v4 over inheritance, merge/precedence engines, drift managers, Cartesian preset catalogs, or lifecycle frameworks.

**Preset/profile is CREATE-only.** `PROFILE/PRESET -> generate candidate CONFIG -> preview -> install`; after install **CONFIG v4 is runtime truth**. Ordinary reactivation/topology maintenance must not reconstruct, repair, normalize, migrate, or silently reapply policy from the profile.

**Additive CREATE:** a new disjoint task/package may be added, but old task semantics must remain unchanged. Exact/parent/child overlap refuses. Semantic template reuse is allowed; same identity with different semantics refuses. Whole candidate CONFIG + resulting cron are validated/previewed before atomic install/read-back.

**Explicit source:**
- local explicit `--source` is authoritative WHAT and must validate;
- no explicit source -> discovery may propose;
- any invalid explicit source -> hard REFUSE of the whole requested set, no fallback and no partial success;
- on initial remote connection, collector must not treat `--source` as established truth before source-side discovery/scope/grant; accepted remote scope becomes authoritative only after that boundary.

**Recursion:** CONFIG HOW field `recursive = no|flat|atomic`; legacy hidden `-r/-R` in flags refuses. Recursion is policy/HOW, not relation topology.

**Frozen engines:** `snapsend.sh`, `snapget.sh`, `delsnaps.sh`, `check-snap-age.sh`, `lib-zfs-snap.sh`; thaw/change only with explicit reviewer justification and appropriate evidence.

## Current compact state — observed 2026-08-10 22:29 CEST

Observed `main` before this checkpoint write: `40bc0522206acf18f69f516621c4452f4118df56`. Always refresh before using this SHA.

Closed gates/phases already established in repo:
- Phase 1 — live safety gate: CLOSED.
- Phase 2 — additive CREATE cannot mutate old policy: CLOSED; REV-092 resolved the CONFIG-global `[excluded:]` residual.
- Phase 3 — endpoint/reactivation preserves installed policy: CLOSED; REV-089/090/091 closed.
- Phase 3.5 — prefixless create / passive `-e` / prefixless GFS expressibility: CLOSED; REV-093 closed with live-ZFS evidence.
- Phase 4 / Gate 4 — public CREATE-time profile selection proof: CLOSED by REV-095; **Phase 5 is not blocked by Gate 4**.

Current open review at observation time:

**REV-20260810-096 — runnable CONFIG examples lack a total semantic-coverage registry for future examples — IMPLEMENTED -> Reviewer.**

Implementation recorded by Claude: `ac6fe3119412a684edf483caa0895fd2bb1e5883` (must be independently verified before approval). Scope is **test hygiene only** for Phase 6 examples: every `docs/examples/*.conf` must be registered for semantic assertions; adding, deleting, or renaming a runnable example without updating semantic coverage must fail. It does **not** reopen REV-094/current four examples and does **not** block Phase 5.

Current routing is always read from `docs/project/OPEN-THREADS.md` before acting.

## Work sequence

Canonical sequence remains:

`CREATE-only additive -> endpoint/reactivation preserves policy -> public --profile at CREATE + preview -> simple local --source/--target workflow -> minimal presets + expert docs -> RESTORE -> optional conveniences only on proven need`

At this checkpoint, Phase 5 may proceed independently of REV-096; REV-096 only blocks the next Phase 6 slice that adds/materially changes runnable examples.

## Reporting format for Owner

For every `Check`, report short descriptions, not bare IDs:

`Phase N — short goal — STATE`

then e.g.

`REV-096 — semantic coverage registry for runnable CONFIG examples — IMPLEMENTED -> Reviewer`

Manual `Check` means an immediate fresh independent review, not a repetition of hourly automation state.
