# Pure/text: a stubbed `zfs` on PATH, no real ZFS, no network, no crontab. The
# stub also records every invocation, so "this command only reads" is asserted
# rather than asserted-in-a-comment.
#
# The pair that carries the whole slice is the creation-vs-name pair. The planner
# exists because nobody can currently say what would be restored, and a planner
# that reported the timestamp embedded in the snapshot NAME would answer that
# question with a story instead of a fact. So one fixture has a snapshot whose
# name disagrees with its ZFS `creation`, and one has a snapshot where they agree;
# an implementation that read the name passes neither, and an implementation that
# warned unconditionally passes the first and fails the second.
